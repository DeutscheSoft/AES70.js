/**
 * Observer of a scalar numeric or boolean property ("target property") of a set
 * of specified objects. This class is a subclass of **OcaNumericObserver**, and
 * differs from that class only in that it observes a set of properties rather
 * than a single property. Does not work for array, list, map, struct, or string
 * properties. **OcaNumericObserverList** emits an **Observation** event under
 * certain conditions. There are three kinds of conditions:
 *
 *  - **Numeric comparison**. A target property value meets a certain comparison
 *    condition. A selection of comparison operators is available. Such
 *    observations are called "asynchronous observations".
 *
 *  - **Timer expiry**. The value of the** Period** property, if nonzero, is a
 *    the time interval for the recurrent timed emission of **Observation**
 *    events. Such events ("periodic observations") are emitted regardless of
 *    the target property's value.
 *
 *  - **Combination of (1) and (2)**. If a numeric comparison and a nonzero
 *    period are both specified, then the **Observation** event is emitted when
 *    the timer expires **and** the numeric comparison is true for at least one
 *    of the observed properties. Such observations are called
 *    "conditional-periodic observations".
 *
 *
 * This is a weakly typed class. Its threshold is specified as an **OcaFloat64**
 * number.
 *
 *  - For unsigned integer targets, the threshold and target are both coerced to
 *    **OcaUint64** before comparing.
 *
 *  - For signed integer targets, the threshold and target are both coerced to
 *    **OcaInt64** before comparing.
 *
 *  - For boolean values, the threshold hreshold and target are both coerced to
 *    **OcaUint8**, True is assigned the value One, False is assigned the value
 *    Zero.
 *
 *
 * Note that this coercion may result in rounding errors if the observed
 * datatype is of type OcaUint64 or OcaUint64. An **OcaNumericObserver**
 * instance and the property it observes are bound at the time the
 * **OcaNumericObserver** instance is constructed. For static devices,
 * construction will occur during manufacture, or possibly during a subsequent
 * hardware configuration step. For reconfigurable devices, construction might
 * be done by online controllers as part of device configuration sessions. This
 * class is normally used for monitoring readings of sensor readings, but may be
 * used equally well for watching workers' parameter settings.
