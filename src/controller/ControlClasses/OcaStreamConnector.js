/**
 *  **DEPRECATED CLASS**   *Replaced by the*  **OcaMediaSinkConnector **  *and*  **OcaMediaSourceConnector **  *datatypes in version 3 of Connection Management (CM3)*  Agent class for objects ("connectors") that allow connection of streams to the device. Streams may be single channels or multichannel groups. A connector is either a  *source*  or a  *sink.*  Sources are sometimes called "talkers". Sinks are sometimes called "listeners". Each connector links to zero or more  **OcaStream**  data objects. Each  **OcaStream**  object represents a signal flow to or from a local connector to a remote connector. The remote connector is usually, but not necessarily, in a different node. Each connector collects zero or more  *signal channels* . A signal channel is an instance of  **OcaNetworkSignalChannel.**  Each signal channel exposes one media channel of the stream to the interior of the device. A signal channel therefore is a Worker that contains exactly one  **OcaPort**  data object. Each  **OcaStreamConnector** object belongs to a particular instance of  **OcaStreamNetwork**  or a subclass of  **OcaStreamNetwork**   **.**  Each  **OcaStreamConnector** is linked to its network through the  **Owner**  property.
 *
 *  - When a controller creates an  **OcaStreamConnector** object dynamically, the controller must store the Object Number of the corresponding  **OcaStreamNetwork** object in the  **Owner**  property.
 *
 *
 *  - Upon receiving the  **Owner**  property change, the  **OcaStreamConnector** object must register itself with the given stream network object via some internal means.
 *   This class may be subclassed to support various network types.
 * @extends OcaAgent
