 * ***and* **OcaMediaSourceConnector ***datatypes in version 3 of Connection
 * Management (CM3)* Worker that allows connection of one or more internal
 * signal paths to a network signal channel.
 *
 *  - For stream-oriented media connection management such as used by AVB, this
 *    worker will be linked to an **OcaStreamConnector** object and to the
 *    appropriate **OcaStreamNetwork** object.
 *
 *  - For channel-oriented media connection management, such as the Dante
 *    name-based routing mechanism, this worker will be linked only to the
 *    **OcaStreamNetwork** object.
