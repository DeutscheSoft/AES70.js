# Changelog

All notable changes and version updates will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.1] - 2022-03-05

- Add typescript declarations for WebSocketConnection

- Raise an 'error' event on AES70 parsing errors in non-udp connections.

- Hand the error object from 'errors' events in WebSocketConnections to the
  application

- Fixed the type of Values in OcaPositionDescriptors. It was previously
  implemented as a Float32, while it should be Float32[6].

## [1.4] - 2022-12-07

- Change the signature of events: Events are now emitted as specified in the
  aes70 standard with a single argument which is the corresponding event data
  struct.

- Fix the encoding of OcaMediaConnectorElement. It was - incorrectly - encoded
  as a single byte.

- Fix typescript declarations of OcaManagerDefaultObjectNumbers

- Introduce explicit types for bitsets for the typescript declarations.

## [1.3.8] - 2022-09-28

- Split UDP Connection into an abstract implementation and a concrete one
  to be used with NodeJS.

## [1.3.7] - 2022-06-26

- Fixed a bug in the testsuite which could lead tests to spuriously fail if they
  run too long.
- Introduce an optional callback based variant for all remote methods in control
  classes.
- UDPConnection: Improve the estimation of the time a command has been sent.
  This can prevent commands from failing spuriously in situations in which the
  send queue is very long.
- Corrected some control class method attributes which were incorrect in the
  standards documents.

## [1.3.6] - 2022-03-13

- Add conditional 'exports' entry for NodeJS and
  'default' for browser environments
- Add wildcard 'exports' entry for files in './src'
- Add 'exports' entry for AES70.es5.js
- Fix handling of incoming notifications without
  parameter data. This bug was triggered by the
  OcaIdentificationSensor.Identify event.

## [1.3.5] - 2022-01-17

- Fix OcaLibrary.GetVolume() signature

## [1.3.4] - 2021-10-04

## [1.3.3] - 2021-08-30

- Fix WebSocket connection under nodejs
- Add index.js to 'exports' as '.'

## [1.3.2] - 2021-08-12

- Fixed some keepalive and close handling errors in
  UDPConnection
- Added new message generator implementation which
  merges PDUs into larger messages
- Improve UDP command retry logic to handle situations
  where many commands are queued in a burst. Previously,
  command could time out while they were still buffered
